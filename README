About the project
===================================
Description:
This project can be used to automatically create a Yocto based
image with Wayland, Qt, QtWayland plugin, Graphic support(OpenGL, OpenVG), QtWebkit, (Accelerated HTML5).
It can also generate a Qt SDK which is compatible with the image.

Goal of the project is to run a QtWebkit based application with hardware acceleration under Wayland.
This gives the opportunity to run WebApps(Html5, Javascript, WebGl) with a Wayland compositor. 

Quick Start Guide
====================================

Command parameters:
Add parameter to create the Qt SDK
--create_Qt_SDK

Set repository branch of Yocto which should be used. the "daisy" branch works accurate and is tested by me.
--yocto_branch=daisy

Build a Weston Yocto image with a compatible Qt SDK
./build.sh --yocto_branch=daisy --create_Qt_SDK 

The image build by the script is located in $PROJECT_DIR/build/images.
It can be copied to the SD card using:

sudo dd if=$PROJECT_DIR/build/images/core-image-weston-nitrogen6x.rootfs.sdcard of=/dev/$DEVICE_NAME


The Qt SDK is located in /opt/poky/.
To integarte the SDK into the Qt Creator follow the step 4.) in the manual-build-documentation.txt which is located under Documentation


For testing Wayland, graphical functionality and QtWebkit follow the step 5.)
