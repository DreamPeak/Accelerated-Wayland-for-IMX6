This project can be used to automatically create a Yocto based
image with Wayland, Qt, QtWayland plugin, Graphic support(OpenGL, OpenVG), QtWebkit, (Accelerated HTML5).
It can also generate a Qt SDK which is compatible with the image.

Goal of the project is to run a QtWebkit based application with hardware acceleration under Wayland.
This gives the opportunity to run WebApps(Html5, Javascript, WebGl) with a Wayland compositor.
